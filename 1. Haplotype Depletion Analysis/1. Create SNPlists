# This sbatch script is intended to be ran as a loop. All chromosomes must be specified as the slurm array task ID when running the code to fit the animal studied. 
# (e.g. sbatch --array=1-29 file.sbatch for cattle)

# Setting up variables
chr=$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
cd [directory for analysis e.g. /
indir= [directory containing genotypes e.g. /Genos]
  ## These two lines create a seperate directory for each chromosome during the analysis, as specified by the slurm array task ID
outdir=chr$chr
mkdir -p $outdir

# Create snp list for chromosome
